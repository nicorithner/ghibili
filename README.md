# Ghibili

A repo for Turing students to practice API consumption and refactoring.

## Challenges

Each of these challenges requires you to consume the [Studio Ghibili API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/)

**Challenge 1**

- [x] Write code to print out the names of all Studio Ghibili films.

- [] _extension 1_: Refactor your code to define 3 different Ruby classes and make use of those classes.

- [] _extension 2_: Refactor your code so that no method body is longer than 5 lines of code.

**Challenge 2**

- [x] Write code to print out the names of all People from Studio Ghibili films.

_extension_: In addition to printing the name for each person, print out the name of each film they appear in.

There are multiple ways to approach the _extension_. Here are some tips:

* Don't be afraid to make multiple API calls.
* Read the API documentation. Try to make the API do as much work for you as possible.
